What is Redux ??

        Its a state management library
        It makes creating complex applications easier
        Not required to create a React App
        Not explicitely designed to work with React
  
Redux Lifecycle:

        Action Creator - Action - Dispatch - Reducers - State
        
Now Considering an Example of Insurance company, our redux lifecycle will be :

        Person Dropping the form - the form - form reciever - departments - compiled department data

Rules of Reducers : 
        
        Always return some value
        control the undefined error, by putting some default values or empty arrays in variable
